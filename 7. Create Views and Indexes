I. Views - virtual table	
CREATE VIEW vw (col1, ...) AS
SELECT (col1, ...)
FROM tb
WHERE ...;
	1. similar as table, but when values in table change, values in view change too
	2. can create view from view
	3. can not use UNION
	4. can not use ORDER BY, but can use GROUP BY
	5. can INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, but with restrictions
	6. can DROP VIEW
	
Ex.
CREATE VIEW envelope (company, mailing_address) AS
SELECT name, address + " " + city + ", " + state
FROM company;

II. Index
CREATE INDEX i
ON tb (col1, ...);
	1. compared with ORDER BY, index doesn't really sort the table
	2. can CREATE UNIQUE INDEX i	// can't insert a value with same index
	3. after col, can add DESC
	4. can DROP INDEX
	5. maybe can CREATE UNIQUE CLUSTERED INDEX i
